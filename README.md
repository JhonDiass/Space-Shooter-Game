 > HELLO EVERYONE!

My name is Jhonatan. I'm 22 years old, living in Santa Catarina - BR and I'm working in a simple 
Space Shooter game using Lua, a brazilian program language.

This idea came in one of my classes that I took in March, where a was learning to code for the first 
time in my life, when my teacher taught the basics of the game and I already was super hiped to continue, 
so I took the project that we were doing in class to upgrade it with new ideas such as new enemies, 
a brand new boss with his own attacks and patterns, and animation when you win the game, etc. And right now, 
I'm sharing with you my work in progress to enjoy it a bit this journey with me!
