 > HELLO EVERYONE!

My name is Jhonatan. I'm 22 years old, living in Santa Catarina - BR and I'm working in a simple mobile
Space Shooter game using Lua, a brazilian program language.

This idea came in one of my classes that I took in March, where a was learning to code for the first 
time in my life, when my teacher taught the basics of the game and I already was super hiped to continue, 
so I took the project that we were doing in class to upgrade it with new ideas such as new enemies, 
a brand new boss with his own attacks and patterns, and animation when you win the game, etc. And right now, 
I'm sharing with you my work in progress to enjoy it a bit this journey with me!



> SO LET'S SHOOT SOME ALIENS

  Here you can see the movements and attacks that the player has: Moving up and down; Shoot; Reload

==================================================================================

  There's an invasion coming, lots of spaceships is coming in your direction, don't let it crash on you or you will lose one heart, if your hearts reach 0 you'll lose and the Earth will be invaded.

==================================================================================

  After defeating some of the spaceships you gotta deal with the Mother-Ship, lookout because it also have weapons like yours and even a big laser canon that take some time to load. Be careful!

==================================================================================

  Yes! You managed to take down the Mother-Ship, now the earth is saved... But don't relax too much, there's another waves coming, stay alert for updates that is yet to come with new enemies and phases.
